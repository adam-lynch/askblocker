# docs

This directory contains stuff needed for documentation, including the website.

## How to update the website content

The content comes from the [main README.md](../README.md). If this is your first time, you'll need to install [Node.js]() and then run the `npm install` command (in this project).

Then just run `npm run compile` to generate the `index.html`. That's it.
